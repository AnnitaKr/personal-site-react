                I am a 2021 Psychology graduate of the University of Manchester. I have focused my studies on mental health and the experimental research of memory. I have gained a First class honours for my degree and my research has been nominated for academic awards. 
                I have worked as a research assistant on two different projects focusing on psychosis and suicide. I am currently looking for more experience in research on my way to gaining a doctorate.</p>
